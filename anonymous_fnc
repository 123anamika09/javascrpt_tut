fnc without name
(function(){

//code
}); 
//place the anonymous fnc inside the ()   otherwise get syntax error
// the () makes anonymous fnc as a a=expression that return the fnc as an object...

 the following shows anonymous fnc that shows a message 
let show = function(){
console.log("hey");
};
show(); 
// no parenthesis required because we assign the anonymous fnc to show 


 // we can often use anonymous fnc as an argument
setTimeout(function(){
console.log("executed after 1 sec");
},1000);



// immediately invoked function execution 
if u want to create a fnc & immediatly wwant to use it after declaring  you can declare the anonymous fnc ...
(function(){
console.log("hey");
})(); // call the fnc by adding trailing parenthesis....
